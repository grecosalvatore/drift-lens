      "  Text: Clipper Chip is a response to the fact that there is no business  or professional body in a position to establish a standard and  provide chipsets to implement it for analog or digial transmission  systems.    RSA might be in position to do it if they had active cooperation of  a couple of manufacturers of cellular phones or desktop phones. .......  Is RSA independt of the gov enough to spearhead this I for one  would gladly pay royalties via purchasing secure phones.   Hear hear I completely agree that we need to work quickly to establish alternatives to the governments Clinton Clipper. As Brad Templeton and others have noted once the Clipper becomes ensconced in enough phones there will be enormous pressure to make it the legal standard and it will become the market standard as well. There is a lot of confusion in the proposal about whether the use of Clipper is mandated about whether nonescrow alternatives will be allowed etc.  There are also unclear issues about how hard or how illegal it will be to make workalikes which meet the standard but which generate phony or untappable keys...Im sure the next several weeks will see these issues thrashed out in this and other groups.  Meanwhile Id be interested to hear RSA Data Securitys reaction. Often criticized in this group for their licensing policies the usual complaints about MailSafe costing too much at  or so and the general issue of software patents... we may find that allying ourselves with RSA is the best thing we can do. Whats a mere licensing fee when our liberty may be at stake If everyone who wanted true security paid say  for a lifetime use of all of RSAs patentswhich expire in the period  or sothen RSA would make tons of money and be happy Im sure. A small price to pay. For those to whom  sounds like too much Im sure the actual terms could be different spread out over several years whatever. To me its a small price to pay.  Strong crypto means strong privacy. Escrowing keys sending copies of keys to large databases and splitting keys into two bit pieces all done with secret and nonanalyzable protocols and algorithms is NOT strong crypto  Whatever some of us may think about the abstract principles of patenting number theory applications this minor issue pales in comparison with the potential dangers of the Clipper proposal note that I said potential...well presumably learn more in the coming months.  The RSA algorithms are at least public have been analyzed and attacked for years and source code is available to better ensure no deliberate weakenesses or trapdoors.  I know of a number of groups putting together voice encryption systems using offtheshelf hardware like Soundblaster boards for the PC and CELPtype software. The new generations of PCs using fast s and Pentiums are fast enough to do realtime voice encryption. Combined with DiffieHellman key exchange this should provide an alternative to the Clipper system.  Of course we dont really know if the Administration proposes to outlaw competing systems. It seems to me that their goal of tapping terrorists child pornographers and Hilary bashers would be thwarted if lowcost alternatives to Clipper proliferated. Not to defend child pornographers or terrorists but limiting basic freedoms to catch a few criminals is not the American way of doing things. End of soapbox mode.  I suggest we in these groups set aside any differences we may have had with RSA and dont look at me....I have both MacPGP and a fully legal copy of MailSafe and instead work with them as quickly as we can.  RSA Jim are you listening  Tim May  P.S. I reserve the right to retract these opinions if it should turn out that RSA Data Security was involved in the Clipper proposal.\n",

The GFA is a nice piece of equipment. Im glad that Adcom had the guts to not overdo the packaging. It irks me when I see audiophile oriented equipment whose case and heat sinks probably cost much more and receive more attention than the electronics they are supposed to serve.  I dont see any big deal about the geographic region in which something is assembled. This is especially true for something as lowtechnology as a GFA.

      "  Text: As John Gilmore has pointed out repeatedly if you produce the infrastructure that would permit a police state to function all that is required to suddenly find yourself living in one is a change of attitude on the part of the government.  Our constitution was built by men who had to risk their lives to ensure freedom in our country. They designed the system to make it difficult for tyranny to arise. For instance one of the reasons the fourth amendment was put there was to make it harder for the government to try to make smuggling a crime. Think I jest John Hancock made all his money smuggling rum which is after all a drug.  Think about it. The government has everyones keys in escrow and the FBI gets their pet wiretap without leaving the office scheme. There is a coup which happens every day all around the world. Within hours everyone in the country who might oppose the tyrants is being monitored more closely than ever before possible.  Without the tools being in place a tyranny cannot stand. With tools like this in place a tyrannical dictatorship could actually be successfully imposed.  Why give the government tools with which to enslave you Maybe you can trust Bill Clinton but are you willing to tell me that you can trust EVERY government that will ever arise in the U.S. hereafter I am not willing to make that leap of faith.   Im a political dissident. As such I am acutely aware of what happens to political dissidents in most of the world. In most of the world I could be killed for my beliefs. Call Amnesty International some time to find out what happens to dissidents in most of the world.  All that seperates the U.S. from most of those places is a thin piece of parchment in the National Archives thats being constantly more and more eroded by such farces as the war on drugs. Coups have happened in countries that have had stable democracies for over a hundred years. Governments throughout history have fallen. No government has lasted for more than a few hundred years. Often they are replaced by dictatorships. Do you really believe so intensely that it could never ever ever happen here that you are willing to bet your own life and the lives of your children and other loved ones on it  If we construct the tools with which tyranny could be enforced we make it orders of magnitude more likely that it could happen because if it happened with the tools already in place it could actually stick.   Naive fools such as our leadership believe they can protect us where hundreds that have gone before have failed. Thriving democracies led by men far more skillfull than Bill Clinton have fallen to dictatorship. Rome had a thriving republic run by exquisitely skilled men before they became a tyranny.  I for one am unwilling to trust that it could never happen here. Only hubris would allow us to believe we are immune to what has happened elsewhere.   Perry Metzgerpmetzger\n",

The last  thing they said was that we needed a special Quadra SCSI terminator  . Anybody know more Thanks   I have been using the PLI SONY . MO drive and now a Sharp color scanner using standard SCSI cables and STANDARD  terminator on my Q.  No problems. If you were using a IIfx that might be another story.  Make sure there is only one terminator in the cabling and it must be at the end. Some boxes have internal terminators some can be switched out and others are socketted. These count. If the box with internal terminations cannot be put on the end to terminate the cabling they have to be disabled ie switched out or pulled out of their sockets. If you have  boxes with internal terminations the terminations in one box has to be disabled.... etc. I am sure that this has been covered by the experts.  My experience with SCSI boxes that connect to the Mac indicates that they must have some software package for the Mac to talk to them. My PLI MO drive and Sharp scanner has one for each.

Most of Windows users only use PCs for text processing or running  rdparty applications anyway so the operating system features are not even  a real issue.

You can call DrawButton  or DrawLine and it does the same thing no matter what platform  or display. It should also translate graphics commands onthefly. so I can use PC graphics SW on my workstation and X software on   my PC. I think GUIs are not just nice to have but essential.

So I can program easily under it and not have to reinvent the wheel if the networking is not up to scratch or my application needs to access sourceobject code on the fly.

This may be a dangerous thing to do. It is my opinion that most educated or well informed people of this country have some distrust of the government. This should exist because as a bureaucracy any government given enough time will tend to exist for it self and not for the original purpose it was  created for. This distrust by the people should keep those in power inline. That and a properly functioning press. When a sensationalism oriented press portrays a group of people as nuts or crazies a violation of those peoples civil rights seem justified. Since we as Americans have the  gurantee of rights as enumerated in the constitution to include the nd ammendment the government must appease the publics opinion or risk  voted out of existance or if it has become corrupt enough to tamper with domocratic process itself being thrown out by force.  Our government as it stands must appease the public. Therefore the  official press releases portray the BDs as fanatics who are a threat to public safety. We must not prejudge people based on one sided information. So far the only information that we are being given is comming from the very agency that was embarrased by the BDBranch Davidians sp. It is to their advantage to make the BDs as fanatical and dangerous as possible. If they were portrayed as lawabiding citizens then theyATF had no justification what so ever of doing what they did.  So lets keep an open mind. Jokes like above even though it may be funny may mislead the public from the truth of the matter.  Just as an aside my understanding of U.S. vs Rock Island and U.S. vs Dalton leads me to believe that the National Firearms Act which allows the Feds in this case ATF to regulate firearmsmachine guns has been deemed to be unconstitutional since .By two federal district courts at least. And since I believe the only reason ATF was involved in this case is because of firearms violations it would be interesting to  find out whether or not the search warrent was based on the NFA. It would be very embarrassing indeed if a search warrent based on a possibly unconstitutional law has resulted in  deathsLaw enforcement.     The above opinions are mine and mine only.

They ignore the fact that areas with the strictest gun control NYCDC have the worst crime and areas with little gun control VTNHID have very little crime in comparison.

      "  Text: It amazes me that you have the audacity to say that human creation was not the result of the natural process of evolution but rather an act of God and then in the same post say that these other processes volcanos et al. are natural occurrences. Who gave YOU the right to choose what things are natural processes and what are direct acts of God How do you know that God doesnt cause each and every natural disaster with a specific purpose in mind It would certainly go along with the sadistic nature Ive seen in the bible.   Adam  Eve TWO PEOPLE even tho they had the honor or so you christians claim of being the first two definitely do NOT represent a majority in the billions and trillions probably more of people that have come after them. Perhaps they were the majority then but I and YOU werent around to vote and perhaps we might have voted differently about what to do with that tree. But your god never asked us. He just assumes that if you have two bad people then they ALL must be bad. Hmm. Sounds like the same kind of false generalization that I see many of the theists posting here resorting to. So THATs where they get it... shoulda known.   Nanci\n",

      "  Text: A question for you  can you give me the name of an organization or a philosophy or a political movement etc. which has never had anything evil done in its name Youre missing a central teaching of Christianity  man is inherently sinful. We are saved through faith by grace. Knowing that believing that does not make us without sin. Furthermore not all who consider themselves christians are even those who manage to head their own churches. Not everyone who says to me Lord Lord will enter the kingdom of heaven but only he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.  Matt. .   Again what historical documents do you trust Do you think Hannibal crossed the Alps How do you know How do you know for sure What historical documents have stood the scrutiny and the attempts to dis credit it as well as the Bible has   Well its really a shame you feel this way. No one can browbeat you into believing and those who try will probably only succeed in driving you further away. You need to ask yourself some difficult questions  is there an afterlife and if so does man require salvation to attain it. If the answer is yes the next question is  how does man attain this salvation  can he do it on his own as the eastern religions and certain modern offshoots like the new age movement teach or does he require Gods help  If the latter in what form does  indeed in what form can such help come Needless to say this discussion could take a lifetime and for some people it did comprise their lifes writings so I am hardly in a position to offer the answers here  merely pointers to what to ask. Few of us manage to have an unshaken faith our entire lives certainly not me. The spritual life is a difficult journey if youve never read A Pilgrims Progress I highly recommend this greatest allegory of the english language.   Now I see by your close that one possible source of trouble for you may be a conflict between your politcal beliefs and your religious upbringing. You wrote that I in my own faith accept and live my life by many if not most of the teachings of christ. Well Christ referred to God as My Father not My Mother and while the maleness of God is not the same as the maleness of those of us humans who possess a Y chromosome it does not honor God to refer to Him as female purely to be trendy nondiscriminatory or politically correct. This in no way disparages women nor is it my intent to do so by my use of the male pronoun to refer to both men and women   english just does not have a decent neuter set of pronouns. After all God chose a woman as his only human partner in bringing Christ into the human population.  Well Im not about to launch into a detailed discussion of the role of women in Christianity at am with only  hours of sleep in the last  and for that reason I also apologize for any shortcomings in this article. I just happened across yours and felt moved to reply. I hope I may have given you and anyone else who finds himself in a similar frame of mind something to contemplate.\n",

      "  Text: Cor  But if we judged ourselves we would not come under judgment.  When we are judged by the   Lord we are being discipled so that we will not be condemned with the world.   Cor  Even though I am not physically present I am with you in spirit. And I have already passed judgment on the one who did this just as if I were present.     Cor  The spiritual man makes judgments about all things but he himself is not  subject to any mans  judgement For who has known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him But we have the mind of Christ.  Jude  Enoch the seventh from Adam prophesied about these men See the Lord is coming with thousands upon thousands of his holy ones to judge everyone and to  convict all the ungodly of      all the ungodly acts they have done in the ungodly way and of all the harsh words ungodly sinners have spoken against him.  Arrogance is a sin. Although a desire to show others of ones rightness may be a sign of arrogance in some cases it may be only a sign that they are following the Bible in others  Jude  Be merciful to those who doubt snatch others from the fire and save them to others show mercy mixed with  fear  hating  even  the clothing stained by corrupted flesh.    I hope you dont find me arrogant then. This sounds like a bad practice  ignoring what certain people say because you perceive them as arrogant.  James  My dear brothers take note of this Everyone should be quick to listen slow to speak and slow to become angry\n",

      "  Text: Firstly I am an atheist. I am not posting here as an immature flame start but rather to express an opinion to my intended audience.  The meaning of my existence is a question I ask myself daily. I live  in fear of what will happen when I die.   I bet some of you are licking your lips now because you think that Im a person on the edge of accepting jeezus.   I was raised in a religious atmosphere and attended  years of religious educational institutions.. I know the bible well. So well I can recognize many passages from memory.      The human being is an animal who has due to hisher advanced mental facilities developed religious as a satisfiable solution to explain the unexplainable. For example the ancient Greeks believed that Apollo drove his chariot across the sky each day was real. Due to the advancement of our technology we know this to be false.   Christianity is an infectious cult. The reasons it flourishes are  because  it gives people without hope or driven purpose in life a safety blanked to hide behind. Oh wow..all i have to do is  follow this christian moral standard and I get eternal happiness. For all of you found jeezus  how many of you were on the brink  but i digress... The other reason christianity flourishes is its infectious nature. A best friend of mine breifly entered a christian group and within months they set ministry guidelines for him which basicaly said this Priority Spread the Word.   We are just animals. We need sleep food and we reproduce. And we die.   Religion especially Christianity is nothing more than a DRUG. Some people use drugs as an escape from reality. Christians inject themselves with jeezus and live with that high.   It pities me how many millions of lives have been lost in religious wars of which Christianity has had no small part.  When Christians see a nonbeliever they say that person is blind to the truth but they cannot realize that it is they who live with this mask of fakeness each day. Jesus was just prophet  who happened to have a large influence because at that time the Romans were circa ad dispersing the Jewish population and communities needed some sort of cohesive element to keep them strong in that time of dire need.  I must go. These are but a few of my thoughts on Christianity.\n",

      "  Text: Clipper Chip is a response to the fact that there is no business  or professional body in a position to establish a standard and  provide chipsets to implement it for analog or digial transmission  systems.    RSA might be in position to do it if they had active cooperation of  a couple of manufacturers of cellular phones or desktop phones. .......  Is RSA independt of the gov enough to spearhead this I for one  would gladly pay royalties via purchasing secure phones.   Hear hear I completely agree that we need to work quickly to establish alternatives to the governments Clinton Clipper. As Brad Templeton and others have noted once the Clipper becomes ensconced in enough phones there will be enormous pressure to make it the legal standard and it will become the market standard as well. There is a lot of confusion in the proposal about whether the use of Clipper is mandated about whether nonescrow alternatives will be allowed etc.  There are also unclear issues about how hard or how illegal it will be to make workalikes which meet the standard but which generate phony or untappable keys...Im sure the next several weeks will see these issues thrashed out in this and other groups.  Meanwhile Id be interested to hear RSA Data Securitys reaction. Often criticized in this group for their licensing policies the usual complaints about MailSafe costing too much at  or so and the general issue of software patents... we may find that allying ourselves with RSA is the best thing we can do. Whats a mere licensing fee when our liberty may be at stake If everyone who wanted true security paid say  for a lifetime use of all of RSAs patentswhich expire in the period  or sothen RSA would make tons of money and be happy Im sure. A small price to pay. For those to whom  sounds like too much Im sure the actual terms could be different spread out over several years whatever. To me its a small price to pay.  Strong crypto means strong privacy. Escrowing keys sending copies of keys to large databases and splitting keys into two bit pieces all done with secret and nonanalyzable protocols and algorithms is NOT strong crypto  Whatever some of us may think about the abstract principles of patenting number theory applications this minor issue pales in comparison with the potential dangers of the Clipper proposal note that I said potential...well presumably learn more in the coming months.  The RSA algorithms are at least public have been analyzed and attacked for years and source code is available to better ensure no deliberate weakenesses or trapdoors.  I know of a number of groups putting together voice encryption systems using offtheshelf hardware like Soundblaster boards for the PC and CELPtype software. The new generations of PCs using fast s and Pentiums are fast enough to do realtime voice encryption. Combined with DiffieHellman key exchange this should provide an alternative to the Clipper system.  Of course we dont really know if the Administration proposes to outlaw competing systems. It seems to me that their goal of tapping terrorists child pornographers and Hilary bashers would be thwarted if lowcost alternatives to Clipper proliferated. Not to defend child pornographers or terrorists but limiting basic freedoms to catch a few criminals is not the American way of doing things. End of soapbox mode.  I suggest we in these groups set aside any differences we may have had with RSA and dont look at me....I have both MacPGP and a fully legal copy of MailSafe and instead work with them as quickly as we can.  RSA Jim are you listening  Tim May  P.S. I reserve the right to retract these opinions if it should turn out that RSA Data Security was involved in the Clipper proposal.\n",
