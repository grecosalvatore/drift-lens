Evidently, nature played an unquestionable important role, but it was always just there, not demanding much attention. She first worked an Art Therapist, and her work involved joining her creative skills with psychological schooling and talents to help people, more so the young children, dealing with their problems – mainly mental problems.\n",

A journalism graduate from Columbia University, her work has appeared publications such as The New Internationalist, Sueddeutsche Zeitung, The Caravan, Economic and Political Weekly and Down to Earth magazine. When she isn't working, Maureen spends much of her time glued to her laptop reading 20 articles at the same time. The rest is spent playing with her two crazy cats, cooking large family meals, biking, learning classical dance and making long international calls. Her website is maureennandinimitra.com.\n",

The project is based on “The End of Retirement,” her Harper’s Magazine cover feature that won the 2015 Aronson Award for Social Justice Journalism. Previously Bruder was the author of Burning Book (Simon & Schuster), about the annual Burning Man festival, which The Los Angeles Times called “quietly poetic.” She has also written for The New York Times Magazine, The Washington Post, The Christian Science Monitor, The New York Observer, the Associated Press, The Oregonian, The International Herald Tribune, Inc. Magazine and O, the Oprah Magazine. She has been an adjunct professor at Columbia’s Journalism School for seven years and, when she’s not on the road, makes her home in Brooklyn with Max the spaniel. \n",
